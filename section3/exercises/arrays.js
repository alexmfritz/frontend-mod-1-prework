//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla"
console.log(animals);
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
console.log(animals.push("Cheetah"));
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals[4] = "Elephants";
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["Waffles", "Chicken", "Sandwhich", "Pizza", "Spaghetti"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
console.log(foods.unshift("Broccoli"));
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
var moreFoods = ["Croissant", "Ice Cream", "Cookie"];
var newFoods = (foods.concat(moreFoods));
console.log(newFoods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
newFoods.shift();
console.log(newFoods);

//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Not a web application example but a 2-dimensional example of an array in real life would be a carton
// of eggs. It is a collection of the same data type. The carton is the array, the eggs are elements.

// 2: Any music streaming service is an example of an array. My "roadtrip" playlist would be the array, with
// 20 hours worth of songs in the playlist would be the elements. P.S. most of that is Taylor Swift ;)

// 3: A website that a school district uses for grading. One teacher enters all the grades from the class
// and then those grades are held in an array that then has a function that calculates the overall grade
// of that class. The school would store all the overall class grades in an array and then calculate a
// students GPA based on that.

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
They can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

if (percentBatteryLeft < 15) { // the condition is checking if the battery has less than 15% remaining - which is true
  if ((chargerType === "car") && hasCharger) { // a nested condition in case the first condition failed, which will check if hasCharger=true AND chargerType="car" (note: both must be met because it's a logic operator)
    console.log("I can call an uber"); // since BOTH conditions were met, the user can call an uber
  }
else {
  console.log("I cannot call an uber"); // out of nested condition... if previous tests fail, user cannot call uber
} // you can test the logical operator above by changing either var hasCharger=false OR chargerType="outlet", if either fail the test then it will not work and the user cannot call an uber
};


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
