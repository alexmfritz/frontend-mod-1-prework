## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

 - The first takeaway from the Growth Mindset article was the use of S.M.A.R.T. goals. I love this concept because it honestly feels a bit like Psuedocoding for goal setting. This seems like a really concise way of breaking down goals effectively.
 
 - The second takeaway from the Growth Mindset video was remembering to track your own progress over time and whenever you are doubting your ability, just take a look at where you started.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- Currently demonstrating:
  * Focusing on the process/mistakes are essential to learning. Failure is one of the most fun parts of growing up and improving. Although, it's only fun if you can sit back and focus on the process and enjoy that aspect of the journey.
  * Tracking your own progress (look at where you came from). I am a firm believer of doing monthly or quarterly check ins and just writing down a list of skills you've gained or further developed during that time, while also making a list of a few small things you're still working on improving. It really helps keep perspective on how well you're doing.

- Currently not demonstrating:
  * SMART Goals. Never been much of a goal setter in order to maintain a realistic attitude towards experiences and opportunities due to being raised in a lower-middle class family. I've worked really hard as an adult to begin doing this, but Turing will be the real test for if I've put in the work. :)
  * Asking for help. Also stems from above. One example is I spent about 3 hours attempting to figure out the last exercise in the loops-array.js because I KNEW I was close to completing it myself. When I finally asked my friend who is a senior software engineer, he took 3 seconds to look at it and give me a hint on what I had done wrong. I fixed it immediately and just laughed at myself because this is exactly what you are trying to teach us!!!

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- Spotify, Apple Music, etc are examples of applications that use Arrays. You can think of a musician's album as the Array with the songs within the album as the elements.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- An array method is a function that you can apply to the array that will make changes or computations to the elements within the array. Array methods are super cool because they are essentially pre-programmed functions that we can apply to an array immediately, meaning we don't have to write functions from scratch!

5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- A loop is used to iterate an action repeatedly. A loop in conjunction with an Array would be used to iterate an action over all the elements within the Array.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- The first example I would give is if you were putting legos away in different color-coded bins after playing with them. We collect all the legos and bins in front of us. For each lego, we pick it up and decide what color it is. If the color is red, we put it in the red bin. If green, it goes in the green bin. Basically we are running a test on the lego to decide the color, and then put it in the matching bin. We repeat the process of picking up the next lego, choosing the color, placing it in the matching bin. Do that for every lego and you have yourself a loop!

- I would use an example of grading papers. In this particular scenario, we want to grade all of the papers in a class. We collection all of the papers (array), and for each paper (array) we run a series of actions: 1) read the paper, and 2) grade the paper. Then when you are done, repeat the process on the next paper until you're done.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- I struggled with the final exercise in the loops-array.js file in regards to referencing the element within the array via array[i] instead of referencing the index with just variable i. I eventually realized I needed to use array[i] instead, but then I was calling it within the for iteration/condition as well. I eventually asked for help, got a hint, and then fixed it quickly! I will be looking for more practice problems on Arrays moving forward before finishing Mod0!!!
