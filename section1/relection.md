## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

- The SuperLearner Article resonated heavily with me because I have experience with a lot of the points made in the article through my time as a professional athlete. The process is so much more important than the destination and remembering to stay focused in the moment will prevent you from not questioning whether you are good enough to complete the task at hand.

- As a professional athlete I've learned through a lot of trial and error that learning is a huge process and there is always going to be a consistent opportunity for improvement every single day. You have to have a growth mindset because it will help you see opportunities you might not see otherwise. Also I've had to seriously figure out how to take care of my body, both physically and mentally to sustain the level of training I've experienced throughout my career.

- The thing I'd like to start doing more is taking short breaks more often. My athletic career taught me to be a workhorse every minute of every day, but acknowledging that even small breaks on a regular basis is extremely beneficial would be a huge improvement for my mindset going into Turing's program.

- The thing I'd like to add to the list is recognizing when you need help and knowing how to appropriately ask for it.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* Number = a variable that holds a value of data in the form of an integer
* String = a variable that holds data in the form of words or numbers surrounded by quotations, apostrophes or back ticks
* Boolean = a variable that holds data in only the form of true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```
console.log('"Hello World!"');
```
or
```
var greeting = '"Hello World!"';
console.log(greeting);
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

- The purpose of a code comment is to help a human reading the code/script understand its purpose

- In order to leave a code comment, you may use //" " or /* " " */

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

- A variable is a container that will tell the computer to hold the value of something for you. The container comes in the form of letters or words.

- For example:

```
variable a = "Alex"; means that I am telling the computer to hold the name Alex within the letter lowercase a
variable number = 7; means that I am telling the computer to hold the number 7 within the word number
```

- This way when I want to reference the name "Alex" or the number 7 later in the code, I can use that variable/container so it's easier for the computer to understand.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

- I often to the website Reddit. I would think that there is a String variable that contains the title of the article you are clicking on, a Number variable in order to contain the "rank" of popularity of the article, and a Boolean variable in order to check if an article has passed or dropped below the rank of another article.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

- The act of combining two variables that were assigned different values by data type within a String via the + operator

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

- Youtube is potentially an example that frequently uses concatenation in order to display the number of views each video has.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

- I am fairly comfortable with everything so far at I finish section1. That being said, I am curious the real world benefit of using interpolation compared to concatenation? Does one tend to take up more space on the computer when you're getting into hundreds of thousands of lines of code? In my personal opinion, interpolation seems much cleaner and easier to read - but obviously both have their benefit.
